Installation
-------
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.


Project Motivation
--------
In this project, Stack Overflow Developer Survey, 2017 is chosen as the dataset to be analyzed and understand the following questions:

1. Which country has the most people conduting the survey? and what level of education do they have?
2. How is the employment status distributed? what is the realtionship between employment status and formal education?
3. How is the company size distributed and how is the company size related to company type? 


File Descriptions

survey_results_schema  -- this filecontains with survey schema, i.e., the questions that correspond to each column name.

Results
------
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here].
